#### library

please reference:https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/contracts.html#libraries

Libraries are similar to contracts, but their purpose is that they are deployed only once at a specific address and their code is reused using the DELEGATECALL (CALLCODE until Homestead) feature of the EVM.
